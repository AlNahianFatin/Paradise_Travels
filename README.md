**A simple Java application for managing travel bookings.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

Paradise Travels is a basic Java application designed to manage travel bookings.  The current implementation provides functionality for managing users, plane destinations, and potentially bus routes (though the code for bus management is not yet fully implemented).  The application is in an early stage of development and lacks a user interface.  This README outlines the project's structure and current capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- **User Management:**  Basic user accounts are stored in `users.txt`.  The `AdminUsers.txt` file may indicate an intended administrative feature.
- **Plane Destination Management:** Plane destinations are stored in `PlaneDestination.txt`.
- **(Partial) Bus Route Management:** The `Bus` directory suggests planned functionality for managing bus routes, but the implementation is incomplete.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) -  A compatible JDK version is required.  (Specific version needs to be determined based on the project's dependencies, which are not explicitly specified in the provided files.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlNahianFatin/Paradise_Travels.git
   cd Paradise_Travels
   ```

2. **Compile the Java code:**  (Requires a Java compiler, like the one included in the JDK.)  The exact compilation command will depend on the project structure. This is likely to involve compiling `m.java`.  For example, `javac m.java` may work if no external dependencies or packages are used.

├── PlaneDestination.txt  List of plane destinations.
├── README.md           This file.
├── m.class             Compiled Java class file.
├── m.java              Main Java source file.
└── users.txt           List of users.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application appears to rely on simple text files (`users.txt`, `AdminUsers.txt`, `PlaneDestination.txt`) for configuration and data storage.  There is no evidence of external configuration files or environment variables.
